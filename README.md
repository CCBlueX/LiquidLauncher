## Compile it yourself!
LiquidLauncher is using Tauri and is written in the programming language Rust, so make sure that it is installed properly. Instructions can be found on [Rust's website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). It also requires NodeJS and yarn.
1. Clone the repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher`. 
2. Navigate into your local repository folder.
3. Execute the command `yarn && yarn build`
4. Now you can start the launcher using `npm run tauri dev` or build it by using `npm run tauri build`
