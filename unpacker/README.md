# LiquidLauncher Unpacker

The LiquidLauncher Unpacker is going to be the standalone executable which will unpack the required files into a folder and assign the required uninstaller to the operating system.

## Why not make it temporary?
The reason why we are not making it temporary is because we want to make sure that the user can easily uninstall LiquidBounce without the manuel step of deleting the files.

## Supported operating systems
1. [ ] Windows
2. [ ] Linux
3. [ ] macOS
